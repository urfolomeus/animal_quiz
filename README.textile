h1. Animal Quiz

This is my attempt at the Ruby Quiz that we started at ScotRUG on January 21st 2010. 
The code is still being written so please don't expect a completed solution yet!

Also, this is not the original version that Paul Boxley and I came up with on the 
night. We got a little sidetracked trying to TDD and I, at least, was utterly confused 
by the binary tree structure and how we were going to code it. :)

You can run the program from the console by typing _ruby bin/quiz_. Until I get round to 
implementing the exit feature, you will need to _ctrl + c_ to exit (What? It's not in the 
original spec!).

Anyway, feel free to fork and add your own take/clean it up/make it better.

P.S. I'm coding this BDD-style so it may appear at times that the code makes no sense 
or is too simplistic. This is just because I'm doing "the simplest thing that works" 
each time until the complexity is required. Honest!
